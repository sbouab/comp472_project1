<b>NOTE:</b> <i>Project1.py</i> contains the project code for the first deliverable (demo 1) while <i>Project3.py</i> contains the complete project code which is the second deliverable (demo 2).
<br>
<br>
How to run the (complete) project code on the (Windows) desktops in the computer labs:
<br>
1) Download the latest (Windows) Python3.7 release from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install* it in any <b>user-owned</b>** directory.
<br>*Choose custom installation, make sure <b>pip</b> is checked, <b>add to PATH</b> is unchecked and <b>for all users</b> is unchecked.
<br>**As an example, I chose to install it in <b>C:\Users\<i>\<username>\</i>\Downloads\python3.7_temp</b>
<br><b>NOTE:</b> The step above is performed because I've downloaded custom Python packages and I can't install them in the Python instance that is pre-installed in the lab as I don't have enough privileges.
2) Modify the <b>PATH</b> variable in the <b>user</b> environment variables by prepending <i>C:\\<python>\\<directory>\\<path>\\;C:\\<python>\\<directory>\\<path>\\Scripts\\</i>; to it.
3) Open the command prompt and run <b>pip install ordered-set</b> command to install the necessary library to run the program.
4) Download https://github.com/sbouab/comp472_project1 repository as a .zip file.
5) Extract <i>comp472_project1-master.zip</i>
6) Put the <i><test_file.txt></i> in the directory where <i>Project3.py</i> is located.
7) Using command prompt, change directories to where <i>Project3.py</i> and <i><test_file.txt></i> are located.
8) Run the following command to run the script: <b>python Project3.py <i><test_file.txt></i></b>.
   <b>NOTE:</b>Output files will be generated in the same directory.
